                    <h3> Who is Trevor? </h3>
                    <p>Trevor is a bright 18-year-old who plays games and watches videos on his laptop. He lives at home
                        with his parents. He attends a special school where the teachers and staff help with his social
                        and communication challenges from his Autism Spectrum Disorder.</p>

                    <h3> Does Trevor face any difficulties?</h3>
                    <p> He has problems with visual information and recognizing things on the page, and his reading
                        skills
                        are not helped by his trouble concentrating on the page or screen long enough to read. His
                        teachers
                        showed him how to make the text bigger on the page and told him how to use a printable view to
                        hide
                        all the ads with moving images that distract him, because he reads every word on the page very
                        carefully and literally. He can be easily confused by colloquialisms and metaphors. He can also
                        be
                        overwhelmed by sites that offer too many choices. </p>

                    <h3> What does Trevor like to do? </h3>
                    <p> He likes using the school’s forum to talk to his friends. It’s easier to just read what they
                        want to
                        say than to listen and try to figure out their facial expressions. He shares a laptop with the
                        family but has first dibs on it because his parents want him to get his schoolwork done. He uses
                        it
                        for homework, but he really likes games with repetitive actions.</p>
